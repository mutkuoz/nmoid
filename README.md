# nmoid
A custom base functional calculation and visualization program for sigmoid formula, using Python and matplotlib library.

# What is sigmoid formula?
Sigmoid function is a mathematical function with a characteristic "S"-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. It transforms any numeric value to a number between 0 and 1. It's calculated as sigmoid(n) equals to 1/1+e-ⁿ.

However, nmoid function is calculated as nmoid(n, b) 1/1+b-ⁿ, where b is the base value we decide instead of e in the original formula. The program gives us opportunity to calculate any nmoid(n, b) value or visualize nmoid values for a specific base in a graph.
